    h2 Welcome!
    span Please visit the tabs above to see a sample of the projects I have been working on since taking on the Lighthouse Labs web development bootcamp in September 2016. I am excited to learn new languages, take on difficult tasks and produce elegant and efficient code. Please visit the #[a(href="/contact") contact page] if you're interested in requesting further information.
